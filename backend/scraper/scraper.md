# Scraper

## Purpose
The scraper will iterate through an excel sheet `title_person_wiki.xlsx` and leveraging `openpyxl` python package we 
will use `Wikipedia-API` to `extract.py` relevant sections (_potentially Early Life, Career_) sections.

Following the extraction, we would need a seperate script using POS
