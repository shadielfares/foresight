This episode is brought to you by The League. I’ve tried all the dating apps, and while there are some slick options out there, the most functional that I’ve found is The League. I’ve been using it for a few months now, and I’ve found some great matches. Unlike most dating apps, which give you almost no information, The League starts you with a baseline of smart people, and you can then easily find the ones you’re attracted to. More than half of League users went to top-40 colleges, and you can make your filters really selective. You can search by interest across multiple locations, and people verify using LinkedIn, so you can make sure they have a job and don’t bounce around every 6 months. It’s a simple proxy for finding people who have their act together, and it’s infinitely easier than trying to figure things out on Instagram or otherwise.

Download The League today on iOS or Android and find people who challenge you to swing for the fences and are in it to win it. Message #Tim to your in-app concierge to jump to the front of the waitlist and have your profile reviewed first.

This episode is brought to you by Eight Sleep. Temperature is one of the main causes of poor sleep, and heat is my personal nemesis. I’ve suffered for decades, tossing and turning, throwing blankets off, pulling them back on, and repeating ad nauseam. But a few years ago, I started using the Pod Cover, and it has transformed my sleep. Eight Sleep has launched their newest generation of the Pod: Pod 5 Ultra. It cools, it heats, and now it elevates, automatically. With the best temperature performance to date, Pod 5 Ultra ensures you and your partner stay cool in the heat and cozy warm in the cold. Plus, it automatically tracks your sleep time, snoring, sleep stages, and HRV, all with high precision. For example, their heart rate tracking is at an incredible 99% accuracy.

Pod 5 Ultra also introduces an adjustable Base that fits between your mattress and your bed frame to add custom positions for the best sleeping experience. It also automatically reduces your snoring when detected. Add it easily to any bed. And for full coverage, you can include the Blanket, which uses the same technology as the Pod’s Cover to extend temperature regulation over your entire body.

And now, listeners of The Tim Ferriss Show can get $350 off of the Pod 5 Ultra for a limited time! Click here to claim this deal and unlock your full potential through optimal sleep.

Listen to our conversation in which we discussed Jerry’s annual two-month sabbatical, how and why even someone on a limited budget can and should make time for their own version of such a sabbatical, successful versus unsuccessful sabbaticals, coping with crises off the grid, hot and cold boredom, and much more.

“I get very, very angry when people misinterpret the word ‘complicit’ for ‘responsible.’ And it’s not because I want to let people off the hook but quite the opposite. I want people to understand that they’ve been an accomplice. When we get into our mindset that says, ‘I am responsible for all the shit in my life,’ we’re actually walking away from doing the hard work.”
— Jerry Colonna

“So many people that I encounter, myself included, spend our childhood pendulating between grandiosity and a sense of worthlessness. ‘I’m either shit or I am the best.'”
— Jerry Colonna

“Good people do bad things all the time. Good people who do bad things who don’t learn are less evolved, less mature, than good people who do bad things who then learn through regret and remorse, but they remain good people.”
— Jerry Colonna

“The best of all the accomplishments I’ve ever done has been becoming the father that I needed as a child, without a doubt.”
— Jerry Colonna

“My capacity to bullshit myself continues unabated. And no matter how progressive I think I am and evolved I think I am, my ability to be deluded by my own mind knows no end.”
— Jerry Colonna

“It’s kind of a fucked up world we’re in right now. But to understand that there’s a human connection that can be gotten even in the midst of all this, I think, is incredibly important right now.”
— Jerry Colonna

“I think that as parents, we can become so afraid of fucking it up and hurting them, that we get wrapped around our own anxiety, our own narcissism. And then we lose the connection, which is the thing that our children want more than anything else.”
— Jerry Colonna

“When you lean into the questions that you need answered in your own life, you end up positively impacting other people.”
— Jerry Colonna

“Can you apologize to your children? Oh, my God, what a powerful tool that is.”
— Jerry Colonna
