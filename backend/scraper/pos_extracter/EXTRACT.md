## Purpose

During the initial development of the `EXTRACT` module, it was designed to handle POS (Part-of-Speech Tagging) apart of the NLP pipeline in recognizing verbs for data extraction.
However, as the project evolved, it became clear that the module was too complex and not sufficiently focused on its primary purpose.
With different approaches being taken for POS tagging, the `EXTRACT` module was deprecated in favor of a more streamlined and focused implementation.
